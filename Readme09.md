# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts 

### What Is an Object?
i will summary the OOP , FIRSTLY anything in java in considered as object it have some properties such as in real life cats it have a age and color and name etc , but in java  object a software bundle of related state and behavior.


### What Is a Class? 
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a simple class can cleanly model state and behavior .

Examble of class :

````
class Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;   
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" + 
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }
}

````

### What Is Inheritance? 

Inheritance is the copying of all properties from one object to another, use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from:

```
class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    // new fields and methods defining 
    // a mountain bike would go here

}
```

In the previous example, the MountainBike object will inherit all properties from the Bicycle object.


### What Is a Package?

A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Placing your code into packages makes large software projects easier to manage. This section explains why this is useful, and introduces you to the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Java platform.


# Lesson: Interfaces and Inheritance

## Interfaces :

In the Java programming language, an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces. Extension is discussed later in this lesson.


Examble : 

````
public interface OperateCar {

   // constant declarations, if any

   // method signatures
   
   // An enum with values RIGHT, LEFT
   int turn(Direction direction,
            double radius,
            double startSpeed,
            double endSpeed);
   int changeLanes(Direction direction,
                   double startSpeed,
                   double endSpeed);
   int signalTurn(Direction direction,
                  boolean signalOn);
   int getRadarFront(double distanceToCar,
                     double speedOfCar);
   int getRadarRear(double distanceToCar,
                    double speedOfCar);
         ......
   // more method signatures
}
