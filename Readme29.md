# Google’s app publishing guide

Publishing is the general process that makes your Android applications available to users. When you publish an Android application you perform two main tasks:

* You prepare the application for release.
During the preparation step you build a release version of your application, which users can download and install on their Android-powered devices.

* You release the application to users.
During the release step you publicize, sell, and distribute the release version of your application to users.

## Preparing your app for release

* Configuring your application for release.
* Building and signing a release version of your application.

* Testing the release version of your application.

* Updating application resources for release.

* Preparing remote servers and services that your application depends on.

You may have to perform several other tasks as part of the preparation process. For example, you will need to get a private key for signing your application. You will also need to create an icon for your application, and you may want to prepare an End User License Agreement (EULA) to protect your person, organization, and intellectual property.

When you are finished preparing your application for release you will have a signed .apk file that you can distribute to users.

## Releasing your app to users

You can release your Android applications several ways. Usually, you release applications through an application marketplace such as Google Play, but you can also release applications on your own website or by sending an application directly to a user.



### Releasing your apps on Google Play
Google Play is a robust publishing platform that helps you publicize, sell, and distribute your Android applications to users around the world. When you release your applications through Google Play you have access to a suite of developer tools that let you analyze your sales, identify market trends, and control who your applications are being distributed to.

Releasing your application on Google Play is a simple process that involves three basic steps:

* Preparing promotional materials.

* Configuring options and uploading assets.

* Publishing the release version of your application.


### Releasing through a website

If you do not want to release your app on a marketplace like Google Play, you can make the app available for download on your own website or server, including on a private or enterprise server. To do this, you must first prepare your application for release in the normal way. Then all you need to do is host the release-ready APK file on your website and provide a download link to users.
