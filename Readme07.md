# Lesson: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
### What Is an Object?

every thing in life is peresnt as object such as car and animals ..etc , Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life,  it's the good way to write your code . 

### What Is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created , can alson difine a class it's the models of state and behavior of a real-world object.

### What Is Inheritance? 

An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface. This section defines a simple interface and explains the necessary changes for any class that implements it. 

examble 

``
Doges doges = new Doges 
``
it this examble we inherit all method in doges class , such as color and hight etc.

### What Is a Package?
A package is a namespace for organizing classes , We can imagine that it is like a box of books that contains books like a box for history books and a box for culture books. Each box has a purpose to organize a process .

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# Classes 
 the clasess it's the namspace that contain many of function  and objects .
 examble

 ````
 public person {
      public String name;
    public int age;
    public String lastName;

    and in this class have a constuctor 

    puplic void person (String name ,int age,String lastName) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    and we have Getter and settter
 public void setname(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
etc ..
 }

 # Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### Decimals
Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which:

The position just to the left of the point is the "Ones" position. If we see a "7" there we know it means 7 ones.

Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller.

### Bases

The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols.
Like this:

### Binary Numbers 

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

Like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97642724/155985605-3a08e8ce-9cec-4fd8-9376-1f26a755bb02.png)

### Hexadecimal Numbers

Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them!

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.

So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10 like this:
